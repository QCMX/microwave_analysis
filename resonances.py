r"""
Module with fit functions for typical resonance shapes in IQ plane.

Also provides factory functions to make `lmfit` model instances with some
parameter hints preset. Note that you can modify parameter hints afterwards.

**Complex values**

The resonances we want to fit are complex valued (as usually measured by
microwave instrumentation). Common fit functions like
`scipy.optimize.curve_fit()` and lmfit only work with real values.  As a
work-around we use `numpy.ndarray.view(float)`. This way real and imaginary
parts are fitted independently of each other (as they should be, since they
are orthogonal).

This means that you have to also use `.view(float)` for the data supplied to
`curve_fit()`. When evaluating the functions to retrieve the model, you have
to undo this expansion by doing applying `.view(complex)`

**Units**

The factors of $2\pi$ have to cancel out, you can either use quantities in
angular units (i.e. $\omega$, $\kappa$, delay $t_d/2\pi$) or frequencies
(i.e. $f$, $f_r$, width, delay $t_d$). Fit functions here are written in the
latter.

**Background signal**

Allows a linear background signal with electrical delay $t_d$ (slope in phase)
and amplitude slope $A_\text{slope}$.

.. math::
    A (1 + A_\text{slope} (f - f_r))  e^{i (2\pi t_d (f-f_r) + \theta)}

The number of fit parameters in `scipy.optimize.curve_fit()` is either all, or
the length of `p0`. So you can only vary the first few parameters of the
function. The parameters are ordered so that the ones more likely to be fixed
are in the end of the argument list.

**Tips**

For fit stability it is recommended to

- scale frequencies close to unity, by fitting e.g. in GHz units,
- remove the phase delay and slope before fitting and not vary them in the fit.

def hanger_transmission_asym(f, fr, external, internal, phi, A, theta=0, delay=0, Aslope=0):

    Transmission in hanger geometry with asymmetry.

    The asymmetry usually comes from additional scattering/resonances along the
    microwave line or in the hanger transmission line. The resonance frequency
    and external coupling factor depend on this additional scatterer.

    We implement the fit function from Khalil et al.
    (`Journ. Appl. Phys. 111 (2012) <http://doi.org/10.1063/1.3692073>`_)
    that gives a robust estimate of the internal quality factor.

    .. math::

        S_{21} \propto 1 - \frac{|\hat\kappa_e| e^{i\phi}}{\text{Re}\,\hat\kappa_e + \kappa_i + 2j (f-f_r)}

    with the real valued internal loss rate $\kappa_i$ and the complex valued
    external coupling $\hat \kappa_e=|\hat\kappa_e| e^{i\phi}$.
    The total coupling is $\kappa_\text{tot} = \text{Re}\,\hat\kappa_e + \kappa_i$
    and real valued. The proportionality factor is the background correction
    shown in the module documentation.

    Remember that if $f$ and $f_r$ are in angular frequencies (i.e. $\omega$),
    then also $\kappa$. If they are in actual frequencies, both are.
